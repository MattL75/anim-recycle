# AnimRecycle

A compilation of animations that I use in various personal projects. This is meant as a simple way for me to load them into a new application. Hence, it will be made into a node module at some point for easier import.

# Features

Most of my core animations are customizable through interfaces. In all cases, the trigger name and timings are modifiable. Other specific animations incorporate a higher degree of customization, such as rotation degrees or scale.

My animations are split into categories. For the moment, I've included fade, size, rotate, scale and variety. The latter is for animations that combine multiple categories for a better effect. Animations with the suffix 'If' are applied on enter/leave (i.e. using an *ngIf) and don't need a flag control.
